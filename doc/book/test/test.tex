\subsection{Test Cases for JOP's GC}

\subsubsection{SimpGC1}

\begin{description}
    \item[Purpose:]
Check if the GC triggers the allocation of memory.
Check if the GC uses all the available heap memory.
    \item[Expected Results:]
The tester should see a message reporting that
the garbage collector was triggered. The tester should see a message reporting
the memory size that should match the heap memory size reported at initialization of the
GC.
    \item[Description:]
The application consists of just one thread which continuously
allocates memory for new objects in the heap. The objects contain
only two integer fields and a constructor that initializes them. The
references to objects are not stored in any variable. The objective
is to have an idea of how many objects of a certain class are
necessary to fill the heap. This measure should be useful for
inducing GC allocation in the next test cases.
    \item[Results Observed:]
9728 objects were created before GC was triggered. GC seems to free
the same amount of memory every time it runs (it always triggers
after the allocation of 9728 objects).
\end{description}

\subsubsection{SimpGC2}

\begin{description}
    \item[Purpose:]
Check if the GC triggers the allocation of memory. Check if
unreferenced local (method scope) objects are garbage collected.
    \item[Expected Results:]
The tester should a set of messages reporting that the garbage
collector was triggered.
    \item[Description:]
Similar to the previous test case. The difference here is that the
allocation of memory is performed through several method calls.
After each method call the objects created are unreferenced. After
GC is activated it should be possible to create the same number of
objects as before allocating any object.
    \item[Results Observed:]
29190 objects were created, 9730 objects before GC triggers, each
time.

\emph{Run out of handles in new Object!}

\emph{GC allocation triggered}

Thus, all the unreferenced objects local to the method were garbage
collected each time GC run.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{SimpGC3}

\begin{description}
    \item[Purpose:]
Test concurrent request of memory from different threads (now using
inheritance instead of interfaces).
    \item[Expected Results:]
The tester should see no exceptions and but several GC messages as
explained below.
    \item[Description:]
We have two threads each creating a linked list. Both threads
add(concurrently) a certain amount of elements to the linked list.
Each element in the linked list has a field with a number. Each
thread keeps an increasing order (with no duplication) of those
fields.  GC is triggered. The Linked lists are checked to see if
they remain correct. We alternate among creation and verification of
the elements in the list, so eventually we run out of memory and GC
is triggered.
    \item[Results Observed:]
No exceptions were thrown during execution, thus object integrity is
fine.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{SimpGC4}

\begin{description}
    \item[Purpose:]
Check the behaviour of the GC when several references to an object
are present.
    \item[Expected Results:]
The tester should see no exceptions.
    \item[Description:]
An object is created and then a reference to the object is "taken"
by one thread each time. A reference to the object is always present
but stored in different places each time. At first the reference is
stored in a static field, then it is stored in a thread's class
variable. The static variable is set to null when a thread acquires
the object reference. In the same way when a thread releases the
object it sets its reference to null. Every time that the reference
is changed, GC is triggered and the object integrity is verified.
    \item[Results Observed:]
GC seems to work fine with this test case. Anyway I think that a
finer granularity in the interaction of threads could make a better
scenario for obtaining a better test (I believe that granularity
here is fixed by the length of the run() method of each runnable
thread).
\end{description}

\subsubsection{SimpGC5}

\begin{description}
    \item[Purpose:]
Check if the GC correctly detects garbage objects.
    \item[Expected Results:]
The tester should see a message verifying that non-garbage objects
are alive.
    \item[Description:]
A data structure similar to a tree is created then references to
certain levels of the tree are stored in class variables. GC is
triggered. The code checks that the objects below the level of the
node for which a reference is held are still alive(and correct).
    \item[Results Observed:]
No issues arose when the test case was run.

Note: It's easy to run out of memory when initializing the tree
(i.e. making the tree "grow" ). I used a binary tree with a depth of
8.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{SimpGC6}

\begin{description}
    \item[Purpose:]
Check if the GC detects cycles.
    \item[Expected Results:]
The tester should verify that the same amount of memory is available
before and after the creation of a set of chained objects.
    \item[Description:]
A cycle is formed by a closed chain of objects, one holding a
reference to the next. To verify that the unreferenced chained
objects are garbage collected, we measure the maximum allocable
object size before and after the allocation of the chained objects.
They should match.
    \item[Results Observed:]
The amount of objects created before GC allocation is triggered was
measured before and after the creation of a set of chained objects.
Through a log file it was verified that the number was the same. For
the Cyclone board and JOP version 01/08/07, the number was 9723.
Note: To obtain a logfile, make japp > myLogfile.

\subsubsection{Ifacmp}
\begin{description}
   \item[Purpose:]
Test if\_acmp
   \item[Description:]
The test case works by testing both an equal and a non
equal(ifacmpeq = 165 and 0xa5 ifacmpne) with true and false
conditions(like a branch and condition coverage test). This leads to
4 if branches.

Following, we have an extract of the .class :

36:aload\_2 \newline 37:aload\_3 \newline 38:if\_acmpne       43 $
\longleftarrow $ \newline 41:iconst\_0\newline 42:istore\_1\newline
43:aload\_3 \newline 44:astore\_2\newline 45:aload\_2\newline
46:aload\_3        \newline 47:if\_acmpeq       52 $ \longleftarrow
$ \newline 50:iconst\_0        \newline 51:istore\_1        \newline
52:iload\_1         \newline 53:ireturn         \newline

We see there that both eq and ne conditions are produced.
   \item[Results Observed:]
The test run Ok.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{BranchTest1}
\begin{description}
   \item[Purpose:]
Test Branchs on reference comparison.
   \item[Description:]
The test case works by testing the following bytecodes:
\newline If\_acmp\textless cond\textgreater, Ifnonnull, Ifnull. All
conditions are provided(both true and false) to every variant of the
bytecodes (i.e., eq or neq). In this way, every possibile execution
is covered.
  \item[Results Observed:]
The test run Ok.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{BranchTest2}
\begin{description}
   \item[Purpose:]
Test Branch on int comparison.
   \item[Description:]
The test case works by testing the following bytecode: \newline
If\_icmp\textless cond\textgreater. All conditions are provided(both
true and false) to every variant of the bytecode (i.e., eq, neq, gt,
lt, etc). In this way, every possibile execution is covered.
  \item[Results Observed:]
The test run Ok.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{BranchTest3}
\begin{description}
   \item[Purpose:]
Test Branch on int comparison with zero(if\textless
cond\textgreater).
   \item[Description:]
The test case works by testing the following bytecode: \newline
If\textless cond\textgreater. All conditions are provided(both true
and false) to every variant of the bytecode (i.e., eq, neq, gt, lt,
etc). In this way, every possibile execution is covered.
  \item[Results Observed:]
The test run Ok.
\end{description}




\subsubsection{ArrayTest2}
\begin{description}
   \item[Purpose:]
Test arrays of references. Test array initialization, length,
storing and loading reference values to and from arrays of
references. Test array related features of the following bytecodes:
arraylength, aastore.
   \item[Description:]
A set of arrays of related types is created, then operations are
performed on them. By storing elements in the arrays, all cases of
aastore are produced. As a means of verification, the elements
stored in the array are checked in the code.

   \item[Results Observed:]
The test run Ok. Issue related to CheckCast.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{ArrayTest3}
\begin{description}
   \item[Purpose:]
Test arrays of primitives. Test array initialization, length,
storing and loading reference values to and from arrays of
references. Test array related features of the following bytecodes:
baload, caload, iaload, laload, saload,
bastore,castore,iastore,lastore.
   \item[Description:]
A set of arrays of primitive types is created, then load and store
operations are performed on them. By storing and loading elements
into and from the arrays, all supported Xastore and Xaload
instruction are exercised. As a means of verification, the elements
stored in the array are checked in the code.
  \item[Note:]
The throw of NullPointerException still needs to be tested.
   \item[Results Observed:]
The test run Ok.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
   \item[Purpose:]
Test primitive type conversion. Bytecodes exercised: i2b, i2c, i2l,
i2s, l2i.
   \item[Description:]
This testcase extends the existent Conversion testcase to include
conversion between all the supported primitive types.
   \item[Results Observed:]
The test run Ok.
