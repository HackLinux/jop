This chapter describes the configuration of a chip multiprocessor
(CMP) version of JOP. The various SimpCon based arbiters have been
developed by Christof Pitter and are described in \cite{jop:dma,
jop:cmp, jop:cmp:eval}.

The project file to start with is \code{cyccmp}, a configuration for
three processors with a TDMA based arbiter in the Cycore board with
the EP1C12.

\section{Booting a CMP System}

\section{CMP Scheduling}

There are two possibilities to run multiple threads on the CMP
system:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A single thread per processor
  \item Several threads on each processor
\end{enumerate}

For the configuration of one thread per processor
