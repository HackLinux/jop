Please assign names (in square brackets) to tasks, and reference them in the source
when appropriate.

[BUG_ARRAY_ISSUE]
wcet.ArrayIssue takes 710 cycles on the sim, but only 43 according to analysis.

[WCET_JAVA_BYTECODES] 
Support java implemented bytecodes
 
[WCET_CHECK_UNSUPPORTED] 
Check for unsupported bytecodes / features rigiously:
It would really be a good idea to first check wheter the code uses unsupported features
(currently: Exceptions, JSR, sync stuff ...) and be explicit about the supported set
  
[WCET_EXCEPTIONS] Support exceptions (simple translation). Catching errors should be
forbidden in real time code. When catching exception, add an edge from 'throwing' basic
blocks to catch blocks.
 
[WCET_EXCEPTIONS_TYPEANALYSIS] 
Improvement for exception analysis: Only connect a throwing to a catching BB if the 
type of exceptions thrown in the former is caught by the latter
Depends: WCET_EXCEPTIONS
 
[WCET_EXCEPTIONS_MULTIEXIT] 
(Needs elaboration): Improve WCET by distguishing ordinary return nodes and dedicated 
exception return nodes, i.e. computing more than one WCET (maybe a nice application for
global analysis).
Depends: WCET_EXCEPTIONS

[UPPAAL_PORT] 
Add UPPAAL simluation (needs to be ported)

[UPPAAL_CACHE]
Add cache simulation (assuming cash flush) to UppAal
Depends: UPPAAL_PORT, flush cash
