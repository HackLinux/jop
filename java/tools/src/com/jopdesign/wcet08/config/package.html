<h1>Configuration</h1>
This package provides a generic configuration component.
<p>
The configuration consists of a set of available options, and the actual configuration
data.
</p><p>
Packages or classes, which need external configuration, provide a collection of available 
options the client may provide.
Those options are explicitly added to the configuration manager at application startup.
</p><p>
The configuration data is loaded using system properties, property files and/or command line
arguments. The classes which need to obtain a configuration value ask the configuration
manager on demand.
</p><p>
Additionally, this component provides help messages, logger configuration and parsing / 
syntax checking of various option formats
