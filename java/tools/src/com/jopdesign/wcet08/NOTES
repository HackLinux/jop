Misc. Notes on the wcet08 project

[Loop bounds]

[Setting MethodGen] Problem with methodGen + visitMethod():
Whenever setMethod is called, MethodGen is deleted.
This leads to a subtle bug: After e.g. replacing iinc , we have to create the MethodGen again.
And if we run e.g. ReplaceIinc after DFA analysis, the analysis is lost !
